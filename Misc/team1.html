<h2>Personal reflection with human enhancement:</h2>

<h3>In my reflection on human enhancement technology, I believe that the biggest ethical issue related to technology in the development of human enhancement technology is dehumanizing, which may damage the dignity of human beings and weaken the inherent value of human beings. Just as Fukuyama expressed concerns about the intervention and enhancement of human body enhancement technology, he pointed out: “Human body enhancement technology may change human nature, bring great threats, and thus lead human beings into the post-human historical stage. Human nature is an important one. The concept, which provides the foundation for the stability and sustainability of human beings as a species, defines the most basic value of human beings. Biotechnology will destroy human nature, thereby destroying human purpose, human right and wrong based on human nature. The concepts of good and evil, appropriate, and improper. More importantly, human nature not only determines the moral behavior of people, but also guides the way people organize their lives, manage themselves, and provide resources in the real-life world.” (Fukuyama, 2003).</h3>

<h3>But even so, I still look forward to the development of human body enhancement technology, because I believe that human enhancement is a human right to freedom. Human enhancement technology can bring hope and welfare so that human beings can become superhuman in the future; and becoming superhuman is Human dreams because human beings are always seeking to transcend the time, space, and spiritual boundaries of their own existence. In the 18th century, the development of human beings through science and technology became increasingly prosperous. As Huxley said: "Human beings have the desire to surpass themselves-the desire of the human being as a whole to constantly surpass itself is called transhumanism, which can surpass its own nature through various new possibilities"(Cabrera, 2015). Furthermore, in the future, human beings will carry out fundamental transformations of themselves based on technology, and can even redesign human living conditions, including modifying the parameters of human ageing, breaking the limits of humans, and the production of human-machine hybrids. This kind of behavior of using technology to interfere with oneself should be supported and respected, because the behavior of strengthening oneself and transforming oneself is a right conferred by modern society, and it is also morally good. There is no essential difference between using technology for enhancement and self-improvement through education, work, and training. As Raam said: "The driving force to change and improve ourselves is the fundamental element of human beings. As a species, we expect to become stronger, faster, smarter and live longer."(Naam, 2005). Therefore, in the modern technological era, human enhancement is a rational choice right that should be protected morally.</h3>
	
<h3>Although I maintain a positive view on the development of human enhancement technology, I must consider the moral issues brought about by human enhancement technology, that is, dehumanizing. Therefore, my suggestion is to avoid meeting technical developments that affect human nature or damage human values and focus the development of human enhancement technology on medical treatment and human physical fitness, so that we humans will not be afraid of virus attacks in the future and completely defeat cancer. We will no longer worry about human health in our lifetime.</h3>
